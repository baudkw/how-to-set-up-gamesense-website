Database name - choose any name you want 
Database username - choose any username you want 
Password - best to make it secure and random use some special characters in there
Now, once you’ve created the database it should appear like below and you’ll be able to manage, delete and change the password if you need to.
If you click the manage button a new page should open and you’ll be allowed into phpMyAdmin to access the database directly.
